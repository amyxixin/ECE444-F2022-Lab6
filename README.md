## Pros of TDD
- Ensures code quality by making sure every added feature and function works as intended before continuing
- Less debugging if issues come up, less bugs, decreases costs of development
- Code becomes more flexible since code is split up clearly into components, easier to maintain or change in the future
- Tests can act as documentation of how the code is being used

## Cons of TDD
- Time consuming since tests are being developed as the code grows
- Requires rewriting of tests every time the code changes
- Coordination between developers to adhere to a standard and expected depth of the tests is required for it to be effective
